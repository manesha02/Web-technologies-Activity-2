      <p style = "background-color:#0B0B4E;"><span style = "color:#FDFEFE;">Python is a <b>widely-used</b>, <b>interpreted</b>, <b>object-oriented</b>, and <b>high-level programming language</b> with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It’s everywhere, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not.
        Python is a <u>dynamic, interpreted </u>(bytecode-compiled) language. There are no <u>type declarations</u> of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. <u>Python tracks</u> the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.
        Python is the programming language that opens more doors than any other. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude of jobs and a multitude of industries. And even if you don’t need it for work, you will still find it useful to know to speed certain things up or develop a deeper understanding of other concepts.</span></p>
