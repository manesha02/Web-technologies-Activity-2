      <p style = "background-color:#0B0B4E;"><span style = "color:#FDFEFE;">Python is a <u>dynamic, interpreted </u>(bytecode-compiled) language. There are no <u>type declarations</u> of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. <u>Python tracks</u> the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.</span></p>
