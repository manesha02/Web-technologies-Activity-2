      <p style = "background-color:#0B0B4E;"><span style = "color:#FDFEFE;">Java is a <u><l>programming language and computing platform</l></u> first released by <u><l>Sun Microsystems</l></u> in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the <l>reliable platform</l> upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.
        While most <u>modern Java applications</u> combine the <u>Java runtime and application</u> together, there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting <u><b>Java 8</b></u>.
        <b>Java Virtual Machine(JVM)</b> is only one part of <b>Java software</b> that is involved in running an application. The <b>Java Virtual Machine</b> is built right into your Java software download, part of the <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b> and helps run Java applications.</span></p>
